# arc_sussex
Development area of coded solutions for the Sussex attempt at the AGI challenge

Conventions for coded solutions is to have a generate and a solve function, with the name of the problem. For exmaple this would be the structure for problem 1:

```python
def solve_1(pattern): #solve given a pattern
    # @param pattern --> matrix
    # @returns matrix
    pass

def generate_1(): #generate a new pattern and the answer
    pass
```

THe filename will be given he number of the problem. So for the above example ```1.py```. This will make everything easier to bind later on.
